## Hopefully tests can help us to write code with no bugs

* Tests help us catch mistakes
* Tests help us shape our design to actual use
* Tests help us avoid gold-plating by being explicit about what the required behavior is
* The biggest value of writing a test lies not in the resulting test but in what we learn from writing it
